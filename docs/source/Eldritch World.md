## Notes

ELDRITCH WORLD acknowledges this seeming contradiction, and attempts to strike a balance between these two paradigms. In ELDRITCH WORLD, characters will indeed work together to solve a mystery, and they will be empowered with abilities beyond the ordinary man, to fight the evil that mankind is too fearful to acknowledge the existence of. However, they must come to realize, over the course of the story, that no amount of help will protect them from the darkness, and that despite their minor victories their ultimate fate is either madness or death.  
It takes a special kind of player to enjoy horror role-playing, and it is best that everyone knows this going in. Players of this variety should know that true heroism is not about slaying the dragon, receiving fame and fortune, or getting the girl. True heroism is about facing insurmountable odds despite the terror that freezes your heart, and doing the most good you can before your time, inevitably, runs out.  
  
*****  
  
At the beginning of a Scene, the Keeper will narrate the opening of the Scene, and present the initial problems the Investigators face. Investigators will then respond to the problems the Keeper introduces until one of two things happens: an Investigator uncovers a Clue, or a Conflict occurs between the Investigators and a mundane or Mythos foe. The Actors will not know which is going to happen until it is already too late. When either of these things occurs, the Scene must change, either to a new time or a new place, as the story dictates.  
  
*****  
  
When the Investigators uncover a Clue, the Keeper receives a Dread token, signifying the mounting tension in the story.  
  
*****  
  
DREAD POOL  The Keeper has a reservoir of tokens called the Dread Pool. Dread tokens represent the rising level of danger and drama building in the story from scene to scene. The Keeper uses Dread to bring havoc onto the Investigators.  
At the beginning of a Chapter, the Dread Pool starts at the number of players (including Keeper) multiplied by two. The Keeper receives an additional Dread token each time an Investigator uncovers a Clue. Also, he has the option of taking a Dread token when an Actor rolls a 6 or below, if he chooses to forego any additional consequences (for the time being, at least). The Dread Pool carries over from Act to Act. After a Chapter, the Dread Pool is wiped out, and at the beginning of the next Chapter, it begins again at the number of players multiplied by two.

● Archaeologist ● Criminal ● Detective ● Doctor ● Journalist ● Student ● Therapist ● Writer  
  
*****  
  
DRIVE  An Investigator’s Drive is his raison d’etre, specifically the reason that the character is involved with the Mythos at all, whether or not he has yet become aware of its existence. Each Profession has a list of 2 or 3 Drives to choose from. A Drive gives an Actor advice on how to play his Investigator, and a way to earn Experience at the end of each session by fulfilling it. Here are the available Drives you will find on the character records: ● Adventure 9 ● Ancestry ● Avarice ● Bad Luck ● Knowledge  
  
*****  
  
& SANITY  Health indicates your character’s current level of physical well-being, and Sanity indicates his current state of mental and emotional well-being. Each of these start at 20. Health receives a modifier equal to your total physical Skills (Strength, Agility), and Sanity receives a modifier equal to your total mental Skills (Will, Wits). Mark your Max Health and Sanity in their appropriate boxes, and put the same numbers under the Current Health and Sanity.

INTERROGATE  When you use violence or intimidation to question a Keeper character,  Roll +WILL ● On 10+, choose three from 7 to 9 list.  
● On 7-9, choose one:  
○ He will give you whatever item you want that he has.  
○ He will tell you what he thinks you want to hear, just please stop!  
○ He will name names.  
○ He will not clam up/go into hiding when you’re done with him.  
○ He will not seek revenge once he’s able to.  
● On 6-, the Keeper will decide.  
FIRST AID  When you attempt to minister to an ally’s wounds (not your own) and you have access to medical supplies, mark off a use of the supplies and,  Roll +WITS ● On 10+, you actually managed to help. The character heals 5 points of Health.  
● On 7 to 9, the character heals 2 points of Health at the beginning of the next Scene. Choose:  
○ You wasted medical supplies (-1 uses).  
○ You exposed the character to infection (-1 to STR until healed) ○ You took too much time, and have gained unwanted attention ● On 6-, you made it worse. The character takes 1 damage.  
  
*****  
  
CRACK SHOT Re-roll a Shoot Move once per Conflict. Ignore any consequences of hitting the wrong target on a Shoot Move. You can still miss, however.  
BRAWLER Treat your fists as a 1 damage weapon.  
IT’S JUST A SCRATCH Ignore damage from an attack once during a Conflict. The Keeper gets a Dread token.  
26 IMPROVED FIRST AID (requires First Aid) Add your Wits to the amount of Health you heal with First Aid if this would not subtract from your roll. Ignore the consequence of 1 damage to the character. Of course, the Keeper may figure out other ways to punish you.  
OPEN BOOK Re-roll a Negotiate or Interrogate Move once per Scene on a character that you have a Bond with.
