# France, Ouessantin - Nadia Ferroukhi

The places spoke to them and transmitted to them the wisdom necessary for life on the island . The women were particularly afraid of paotr ar vrummen, the guy who raises the mist by whipping the sea with his broom twig so that all of a sudden you can't see anything. Young girls taken in this way were advised by their mothers to sit down immediately on the grass and not move while waiting for the day!
