Interested in earning some money from your WordPress blogging? Here are 7 ways to get started.

## Highlights

> Of course, all approaches monetizing a WordPress blog require some extra work, and there’s certainly no surefire way to get rich quickly

>
> 1. Place display ads.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 14:54:16
>
> These ads may appear on your pages as static displays, popups, and/or native ads. It may even make sense to install a WordPress theme with ad space if you think this is the right direction for your website.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 14:54:35
>
> pay-per-click (PPC) model and the pay-per-impression (PPI) model

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 14:54:42
>
> In a PPC model, you receive payment whenever someone clicks on a display ad on your site. In a PPI model, you’re paid whenever a user sees an ad. PPC models will earn you more as long as users click them at a consistent rate.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 14:55:10
>
> Your network pays you for your ad clicks/impressions and determines which ads will appear on your site, so be sure to choose a reputable network if you opt to show ads.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 14:55:21
>
> Far and away the most popular ad network for WordPress is Google AdSense.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 14:55:36
>
> there are plenty of Google AdSense alternatives to try as well.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 14:55:53
>
> However, there are some things you should know before trying yourself:
>
>Reputable networks like AdSense have pretty strict requirements you must meet to become a partner. One common requirement is having an existing catalog pool of quality blog posts. Brand new bloggers likely won’t be eligible on this basis.
>You’ll need a good amount of traffic to earn significant income from display ads alone, let alone a full-time salary. Some ad networks have a minimum monthly traffic requirement to even get started.
>Users generally find ads occasionally useful at best and frustrating at worst, especially if you place too many per page. A blog cluttered with distracting ads can damage trust with your readers.
>Many users install ad blockers or develop “banner blindness” — both are obstacles to display ad monetization.

> 2. Become an affiliate marketer.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 14:56:26
>
> Compared to advertisements, this option is better for the user experience and has the potential to be more profitable.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 21:14:37
>
> Affiliate marketers promote third-party products in their blog content

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 21:14:51
>
> Blogs are a particularly good platform for affiliate marketing because there are many opportunities for affiliate link placement. For example, you could write a review of a product, or mention a product in a post about some larger topic.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 21:15:00
>
> Amazon Associates is the biggest player in the affiliate marketing space, with over two million affiliates. With Amazon Associates, you can place affiliate links for any product available on Amazon and get rewarded for any purchase on the site through your link (not just products you promote). Placing these links on WordPress is relatively easy, and there are even plugins to help manage your Amazon links.

> You can also start with our list of the best affiliate programs.

> Interested? Here are some tips for getting started with affiliate marketing on WordPress:
>
>The best affiliate marketers truly enjoy and benefit from the products they promote. Be genuine and selective about your products so readers will trust your recommendations.
>Follow the rules for your affiliate program(s) and always disclose in your post when your links are affiliate links.
>Like display ads, you won’t profit from an affiliates program if you lack an audience. Build out your readership with excellent content before placing affiliate links.
>Promote products within your area of expertise. There’s no need to change your content to suit your monetization strategy — there’s very likely an affiliate marketing program within your blogging topic.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 21:15:21
>
> 3. Write sponsored blog posts.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 21:15:26
>
> 4. Sell exclusive content.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 21:15:42
>
> Exclusive posts: These posts provide extra value in addition to your free posts. Exclusive blog posts can be entirely new pieces, or they could expand or augment existing posts.
>Printable blog posts: Another option is converting your longest posts into printable PDFs that users can purchase. You might also add some bonus exclusive content to these PDFs, like a summary or worksheet for instructional posts. One of my favorite writers, Tim Urban of the popular blog Wait But Why, utilizes this method.
>Ebooks: Ebooks are well-suited for blogs. They take less time and effort to produce than other forms of content, they’re typically affordable, and you can even create one from old blog content. In fact, we have a free ebook to help you start making your own.
>Courses: The next step above an ebook is a full online class around your topics. Use your existing blog content as a starting point, and present your knowledge in a digestible format for students via written and/or video content. This will take some serious effort, but you can utilize an e-learning plugin like LearnPress to help build out your course.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 21:16:07
>
> To sell readers on your paid offer, however, you need to prove your value with free content first. In addition to your public blog posts, you can create free versions of any of the content types I’ve listed. This will signal your knowledge and quality to old and new readers before they start spending.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 21:16:13
>
> 5. Sell merchandise.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 21:16:15
>
> 6. Offer membership.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 21:16:27
>
> This method of monetization is more reliable than one-time paid content since membership costs are recurring, but it’s also far more work. Not only do you need to garner a large enough following and prove your value with free resources, but you also need to shift your content strategy to accommodate for regularly updated premium content. If you’re ready for the commitment, see our guide to creating a membership site in WordPress.
>However, this guide would be incomplete if I didn’t mention an alternative membership service, Patreon.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 21:16:37
>
> Patreon handles the content gating, membership tiers, and payments for you, and takes a percentage fee from your recurring revenue. If you’re ok with the cost, Patreon is a lightweight alternative to building a membership site from scratch.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 21:16:40
>
> 7. Ask for donations.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 21:16:45
>
> If you lack the time and resources to produce exclusive paid offers, you can request one-time or recurring donations from your readers.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 21:16:53
>
> While donations are less likely to bring consistent income, they’re a low-effort, low-key approach that lets you focus on your writing above all else. Getting started is as simple as placing CTAs to a payment processor like PayPal, and a PayPal plugin for WordPress can help integrate this processor with your site.

> [!quote]+ Updated on 2022/12/17 21:17:05
>
> Note that the term “donation” can connote a charitable cause or nonprofit mission, so be careful about using that word, especially if you use this method in conjunction with other monetization strategies. Asking for donations while pushing ads can come off disingenuous — using the word “Support” or setting up a Patreon page might be a better alternative for crowdsourced revenue.
