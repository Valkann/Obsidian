It is likely your use case is at the intersection of several apps, and that you may need to use two or more of them in combination to achieve your goals

it’s better to make a conscious effort to avoid building a Frankeinstein’s monster of a productivity system.

Finally, try to not keep on switching note-taking apps too often.

The more you invest in your note-taking tool, the more value you will get out of it.

G.R.R. Martin, the author of A Song of Ice and Fire (better known by the title of its first book, Game of Thrones), said:
> “I think there are two types of writers, the architects and the gardeners. The architects plan everything ahead of time, like an architect building a house. They know how many rooms are going to be in the house, what kind of roof they’re going to have, where the wires are going to run, what kind of plumbing there’s going to be. They have the whole thing designed and blueprinted out before they even nail the first board up. The gardeners dig a hole, drop in a seed and water it. They kind of know what seed it is, they know if planted a fantasy seed or mystery seed or whatever. But as the plant comes up and they water it, they don’t know how many branches it’s going to have, they find out as it grows. And I’m much more a gardener than an architect.”

Similarly, there are three main note-taking styles:
- **The architect.** They enjoy planning, designing processes and frameworks, and need a note-taking tool that allows them to easily structure their ideas.
- **The gardener.** They enjoy exploring, connecting various thoughts together, and need a note-taking tool that allows them to easily grow their ideas.
- **The librarian.** They enjoy collecting, building a catalogue of resources, and need a note-taking tool that allows them to easily retrieve their ideas.

### Note-taking apps for architects

Architectural note-taking apps rely on a hierarchical structure based on pages and categories. As such, they require a bit of planning to decide whether an idea deserves its own category, its own page, or just its own block of content.

Beware that these note-taking apps can have a steep learning curve. If your goal is just to take notes so you can build a library to look back at whenever you need to retrieve an idea, you may not need all the bells and whistles.

### Note-taking apps for gardeners


A few key features make these apps for gardeners different from the more structured ones. Instead of having a template-first approach, they are more akin to the process of simultaneously exploring and building a map in a video game.

Non-linear, these apps offer bi-directional linking, allowing you to not only see what a note links to, but what notes link back to it. Some let you access both explicit and implicit links, so you can discover connections between ideas that you may have not made yourself. Some even have a visual knowledge graph, so you can literally explore a map of your ideas.

### Note-taking apps for librarians


Note-taking apps do not have to be more than a place to store and retrieve information you care about. In the words of American writer Sidney Sheldon: “Libraries store the energy that fuels the imagination.”

Web clipping, rich formatting, file attachment, tagging, and a way to filter your notes is all you need to quickly save and access what you need, whether it’s some book notes, meeting notes, or a recipe. These apps allow you to do just that.

### Note-taking apps for quick capture

Not everyone heavily relies on note-taking to capture, organise, and retrieve their thoughts. If you just need a lightweight solution for those lightbulb moments or to put together a quick to-do list, you can also use a quick capture note-taking app. In fact, many people use a quick capture app in addition to a fully-fledged note-taking tool.

The challenge with these apps is that many people end up building a [mind backyard instead of a mind garden](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden). Which is fine if your goal is just to dump some thoughts for immediate use. But if you want to go from collector to creator—whether you are an architect, a gardener, or a librarian—it may be helpful to consider a note-taking app from the previous categories.

### Choosing the right app


There are two ways you can choose your note-taking app: based on your note-taking style, or based on your use case.
-   **Need to store a large amount of mostly static information in order to easily retrieve it later?** A library may be appropriate.
-   **Need to brainstorm new ideas?** In this case, you may want to use an app for gardeners, which is better for free thinking and creative work.
-   **Need to organise a large project and manage your productivity?** You may need some structured frameworks and workflows, which may be easier to put in place with a note-taking app for architects.

you get to pick and choose the tools that make the most sense for your specific goals.

Again, just make sure to pick a couple of apps at most, and to stick with them for long enough so you don’t waste too much time re-designing your workflow every time you switch. Taking notes is a powerful habit to build; one that can dramatically increase your productivity and your creativity. Choose your weapon, and don’t wait for too long to get started.
