# The Bad Time Game SRD


***

## Notes

the core of the system is not to empower success but to encourage failure for the purposes of storytelling and player enjoyment  
  
*****  
  
Comedy in TTRPGs is typically coincidental rather than purposeful, or generated more so by player in-jokes than it is the actual mechanics of the game  
  
*****  
  
schadenfreude  = plaisir de nuire
  
*****  
  
Anything and everything is possible, so long as you remember one thing:  
Whatever you do, you’re here to have a Bad Time, so the table can have a good time.  
  
*****  
  
Characters in any Bad Time Game are made up of their Name, Appearance, Personality, and Stats  
  
*****  
  
you have 4 points to allocate across 5 statistics [Smart, Sexy, Subtle, Strong, and Snarky]. Those five terms help bring players into the mindset that they are not creating characters who have a lot of depth, and who will most likely go on to have untimely deaths  
  
*****  
  
The core of the Bad Time Game is the Bad Time Dice and Bad Time Mod systems  
  
*****  
  
The Bad Time Dice are a group of 4d4 rolled against a roll-under system. For each point a character has in the stat applicable to the action they want to undertake, they roll one less die. The aim is to roll a value of 7 or lower. Roll 8 or above, you fail your action and add +1 to the Bad Time Modified (a.k.a. Bad Time Mod). Roll 16 or above? Your character has a BAD TIME, which can mean any number of things. A magnificent failure. Being spotted cheating. Or, in the absolute worst case scenario, death.  
  
*****  
  
it was also instituted to prevent what should be a snappy game from going on for longer than it has to  
  
*****  
  
Another core idea behind Bad Time Games is that they are always two phase games  
  
*****  
  
In one Phase, you act in some fashion. In the other, you are reacting.  
  
*****  
  
Of course, the two phase structure is more of a recommendation. You could easily smash the phases together and create one mega-phase, or parcel the game out into several different phases, or avoid this back and forth altogether by creating points in time where your Bad Time Mod is reset.  
  
*****  
  
Why, the one that states that for every ACTION, there is an equal and opposite REACTION. Aftermaths  
  
*****  
  
Bad Time Games should always have a mechanic for any player eliminated by the Bad Time Dice to stay and join in the fun.  
  
*****  
  
In End of the Line this mechanic manifests as Ghosts - players who have been eliminated from the game linger at the table to heckle, hinder, or help the living  
  
*****  
  
This comes in the form of a once per phase ability to force a reroll, which is a small but powerful tool to change the game’s dynamic.  
  
*****  
  
This was a system whose first inspiration was Final Destination,  
  
*****  
  
A “traditional” Bad Time Game, if you can say a game has a tradition, is a quick and dirty game for a bunch of laughs.  
  
*****  
  
End of the Line  
  
*****  
  
A more technical name for the Bad Time Game system is Murphy’s Law: The SRD. Embrace the bad times, and embrace the chaos.  
  
*****  
  
With the way the Bad Time Dice are designed, you are intentionally creating an environment that encourages failure. Comedy and schadenfreude add levity to failure, so that players can abstract the failures from themselves rather than feeling that failure personally.  
  
*****  
  
An Intentional Descent - This is a journey about characters losing everything, and specifically playing to lose  
  
*****  
  
A Recursive Game - AKA the Time Loop game. Some time ago, Justin Ford of Mothland Games wrote a blog post about the potential of a TTRPG where you repeat time again and again…  
  
*****  
  
From Happy Death Day to ERASED to All You Need Is Kill, it’s easy to see how ending in the hard reset of death allows you to begin again.
