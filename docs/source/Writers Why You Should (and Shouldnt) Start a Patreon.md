> For patrons, Patreon is a way to join your favorite creator's community and pay them for making the stuff you love. Instead of literally throwing money at your screen (trust us, that doesn’t work), you can now pay a few bucks per month or per post that a creator makes.  For example, if you pay $2 per video, and the creator releases 3 videos in February, then your card gets charged a total of $6 that month.

> So, if you’re debating starting a Patreon for your writing, first think about the size of your audience, and what exactly you have to offer. And if you do go through with it, don’t freak out when you don’t immediately shoot into the triple digits.
