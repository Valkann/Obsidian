# The Youdig

_Mystery in 1970s French's britain_

## Story

The Youdig is a hole in the middle of the Yeun Elez, a swamp known for housing the gates of hell. They have remained underwater thanks to the construction of a barrage, but with the arrival of the power station in 1962, the water has been rerouted to cool the tanks and the gates are about to open. Eugène Chausson, a young and energetic employee of the power station, discovers the Youdig and its attractive call...

## Hook

While Brittany is experiencing an unusual drought season, two tourists who came to visit the area were found drowned, claw marks from a large dog on their bodies and strange mutilations rendering them unrecognizable. One of your contacts Erwan Malzieu, suspecting a mystery, called you. That was three days ago and he has been unreachable ever since.

## Monster

### Len-ar-Youdig (The Hole of the Youdig)

The Youdig, or hole of the Youdig, is located under the waters of the Saint Michel reservoir. As some of the water was redirected for the power station, this allowed this gateway to the underworld to extend its influence over the Yeun Elez. The marshes are once again home to will-o'-the-wisps, bitterns, who act as spies and black dogs.

**Nature**: Teratogen (motivation: to turn creatures and people into monsters).

### Powers

**Controlling creatures (will-o'-the-wisp, bitterns, black dogs)**

The Youdig controls the creatures of the swamp and can impose his will on them.

**Controlling the climate, Controlling the waters**

The Youdig can change the climate and water levels in his area of influence, making conditions difficult for humans.

**Confer magical powers (such as a pact with the Devil).**

The Youdig can make a pact with a person: that person obtains magical powers and in exchange becomes a henchman of the Youdig and must act according to his orders.

**Call of the Youdig**

When you resist the call of the Youdig, roll **2d6+Cool**

- On a 10+, you may decide not to obey. If you obey, check off experience and gain +1 temporary.
- On a 7-9, you can decide not to obey. If you obey, check off experience. If you do not obey, gain +1 the next time he tries to hypnotise you.
- If unsuccessful, do as he asks.

**Resistance:** He is invulnerable to weapons.

**Faiblesse :** Filling the tank will block the powers of the Len-ar-Youdig, a relic of Saint Michael will close the door, an exorcism will free a person from the influence of the Youdig.

**Attaque :** 
- Invisible arm (ignores armour, draws towards the hole)
- Geyser (2 damage, ignore armour, heat)

## Countdown

**Day**
    
Erwan warns you and starts to investigate on his own towards the marsh

**Penumbra**
    
Erwan is captured at night near the swamp and brought before the Youdig. He succumbs to the Youdig's influence.

**Twilight**

Eugene and Erwan, helped by the will-o'-the-wisps, guide tourists from the campsite to the Youdig to feed it.

**Sunset

The control of the Youdig is reinforced. Erwan and Eugene suggest to the inhabitants of Brenillis and the police that they organise a search in the marshes to find the missing people.

**Nightfall  

The Youdig feeds on the people of the hunt and its influence grows stronger. The water in the reservoir begins to decrease.

**Nightfall**

The swamp is visible again, revealing a black well in its centre. The Youdig is released and the gates of hell are ready to open.
